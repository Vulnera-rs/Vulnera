//! Vulnerability analysis services
//!
//! This module contains application services that support vulnerability analysis operations.
//! These services provide cross-cutting concerns like caching, reporting, version resolution,
//! repository analysis, and popular package management.
//!
//! Note: The cache service trait is defined here, but the concrete implementation
//! is in the infrastructure layer.
